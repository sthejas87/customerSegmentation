# Customer Segmentation and Analysis

This repository dives into customer segmentation and analysis using various methods like univariate and multivariate analysis, and k-means clustering.

## Introduction

Understanding customers is key for business success. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify meaningful segments and insights.

## Analysis Techniques

### Univariate Analysis

Understanding individual variables is crucial. We explore distributions and characteristics, like income and spending scores, to grasp their essence.

### Multivariate Analysis

Examining relationships between multiple variables uncovers patterns and dependencies, helping us gain deeper insights into customer behavior.

### K-means Clustering

Using k-means clustering, we group customers based on similarities, allowing for targeted strategies and personalized approaches.

## Implementation

Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn are leveraged for analysis and visualization.

### Data Preparation

Data is cleaned, missing values handled, and categorical variables encoded to ensure smooth analysis.

### Univariate & Bivariate Analysis

Visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps provide a comprehensive understanding of customer attributes and relationships.

### Multivariate Clustering with PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dimensionality, and k-means clustering helps identify clusters, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

## Results

Segmentation results are evaluated and visualized to derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
